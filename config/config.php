    *** PLEASE GIVE TRONGATE A STAR ON GITHUB ***
    https://github.com/davidjconnelly/trongate-framework

    Trongate is the only PHP framework in the world that 
    is committed to using PHP the way that it was intended 
    to be used.  That means; no frequent rewrites, no Composer, 
    no Packagist, no third party library dependency and definitely 
    no certification.

    The Trongate framework and the Trongate Desktop App will always 
    be free. That's a promise.  All we ask is, if you like Trongate, 
    please give us a star on GitHub.  We really need your support.

    Thank you!
